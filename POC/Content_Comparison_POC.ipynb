      "DESCRIPTION  \n",
      " Acupuncture is a form of complementary and alternative medicine that has been widely practiced for many \n",
      "centuries. It involves the stimulation of specific anatomical locations on the skin through the penetration of fine \n",
      "--- Page 3 ---\n",
      "Acupuncture (CPG 024) \n",
      "Page 3 of 38 needles, with the goal of relieving pain or treating disease. Stimulation can be accomplished manually (i.e., by a \n",
      "twisting motion of the hand) or through such methods as electrical stimulation (i.e., electroacupuncture). The \n",
      "practice of traditional acupuncture is predicated upon several fundamental underlying principles. It is predicated upon the existence of a series of meridians that course through the body along which are located discrete points \n",
      "that correspond to specific organs and/or have particular clinical significance. A vital energy, “chi,” flows through \n",
      "the meridians and the acupuncture points and regulating bodily functions. It is the disruption of this flow of energy that therapeutic acupuncture is said to address.  \n",
      " Acupuncture typically utilizes unique diagnostic procedures to evaluate the meridian/chi system. This includes an \n",
      "evaluation of the patient’s chief complaint and related health status through standardized diagnostic interviewing and examination techniques.  Interviews are based on the traditional Ten Questions and examinations include, but \n",
      "are not limited to, evaluation of meridians, points, general vitality and behavior, the radial pulses and the tongue. \n",
      "Based upon the patient’s complaint and the findings of these diagnostic procedures, individualized treatment \n",
      "regimens are developed that specify treatment variables such as the acupuncture points to be utilized, needle \n",
      "placement, and type of needle stimulation.  \n",
      "Acupuncture point injection therapy is a procedure where pharmaceuticals and natural biologic products such as \n",
      "vitamins, herbal extracts and other homeopathics, are injected into the body at acupuncture points to prevent or \n",
      "treat disease. One solution in particular, isotonic saline, when injected theoretically allows activation of the \n",
      "acupuncture point for a longer period of time enhancing the therapeutic effect.  \n",
      " \n",
      "GENERAL BACKGROUND \n",
      " A majority of states provide licensure or registration for acupuncture practitioners, although the scope of practice \n",
      "allowed under state requirements varies. Depending upon the jurisdiction, those licensed to administer acupuncture may include licensed acupuncturists (LAc), medical/osteopathic physicians (MD/DO), chiropractors \n",
      "(DC), naturopaths (ND), oriental medicine doctors (OMD), podiatrists (DPM), dentists (DDS/DMD), nurse \n",
      "practitioners (NP), physician assistants (PA), as well as other designated health care providers. Depending upon \n",
      "the practitioner’s training, different systems of acupuncture diagnosis and treatment may be used. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Panel and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) consider acupuncture safe when performed by qualified practitioners using sterile needles. The FDA requires that sterile, \n",
      "nontoxic needles be used and that they be labeled for single use by qualified practitioners. Acupuncture appears to be a relatively safe treatment with rare serious adverse side effects when performed by qualified practitioners \n",
      "who consistently adhere to the recommendations of the FDA regarding the use of sterile needles.  \n",
      "Depending on the pain condition being treated, a course of acupuncture may last several weeks. Although there \n",
      "is no consensus in the scientific literature regarding the optimal number of acupuncture treatments to administer or the duration of treatment for  any condition, in general, there should be a reasonable expectation for clinical \n",
      "improvement. If no improvement is documented after an initial trial of two- four weeks treatment, an alternative \n",
      "treatment plan should be considered. If lack of clinical improvement continues following subsequent treatments \n",
      "re-evaluation by the referring provider may be indicated. If measurable objective improvement is made, then \n",
      "progress towards identified goals should be clearly documented and the treatment plan updated accordingly. The \n",
      "necessity of continued care beyond a therapeutic trial is dependent upon objective evidence of improvement (i.e., \n",
      "functional gain).  \n",
      "Multiple different biological mechanisms have been proposed and studied to explain acupuncture. All of these \n",
      "proposed mechanisms are centrally mediated and not merely local physiologic responses. Most commonly it is thought that the stimulation of the acupuncture needle triggers the release of endogenous opioids (endorphins). \n",
      "This effect seems the most pronounced in electro -acupuncture. Another possible mechanism is through the diffuse \n",
      "noxious inhibitory control pathway (DNIC). According to DNIC, a noxious stimulus applied to any region of the \n",
      "body can induce immediate suppression of pain transmission in neurons of the trigeminal caudalis and/or the spinal dorsal horn. Another theory proposes that the descending serotoninergic inhibitory pathway is key to acupuncture analgesia. In addition, there is some preliminary evidence that acupuncture may have effects on the \n",
      "inflammatory response mediated through the autonomic nervous system. Current available evidence indicates \n",
      "that insertion of acupuncture needles has an effect above waiting list controls but there is limited available \n",
